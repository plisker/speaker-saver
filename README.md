# SpeakerSaver

## Overview

**SpeakerSaver** is a Python-based solution designed to automatically manage and control your powered speakers connected via a smart plug. The primary goal is to ensure your speakers are turned off when not in use, specifically when no music has been played for a certain period or when the connected TV is off. This project also provides health monitoring, allowing you to check the status of the system.

## Features

- Automatically turns off speakers if no music is playing on Spotify or the TV is off.
- Integrates with Kasa smart plugs to control the power state of the speakers.
- Includes a health check endpoint to monitor the status of the running service.
- Logs system activities, with automatic log rotation to prevent log file overflow.

## Setup and Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository

First, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/speakersaver.git
cd speakersaver
```

### 2. Set Up the Python Environment
Create a virtual environment and install the required dependencies:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### 3. Run the Setup Script
Run the setup script to configure the environment variables. This script will prompt you to input the necessary details, such as your Spotify `CLIENT_ID`, `CLIENT_SECRET`, and the IP addresses of your speakers and TV:

```bash
python setup_env.py
```
This script will generate a `.env` file with your configurations.

### 4. Authorize Spotify Access
The first time you run the `auth.py` script, you'll need to authorize your Spotify app. Start the Flask server:

```bash
python -m src.auth
```
Navigate to the `/authorize` endpoint in your browser to complete the Spotify authorization process. For example, if you're running the Flask server locally, visit `http://localhost:8888/authorize`.


## Running the Project
### 1. Running Locally
To run the main monitoring script:

```bash
python -m src.main
```
To start the Flask server for handling Spotify authorization and exposing health endpoints:

```bash
python -m src.auth
```
### 2. Deploying to Raspberry Pi
#### Step 1: Transfer the Project to Raspberry Pi
Use `scp` to copy the entire project directory to your Raspberry Pi:

```bash
scp -r /path/to/speakersaver pi@<raspberry_pi_ip>:/home/pi/speakersaver
```
#### Step 2: Set Up the Environment on Raspberry Pi
SSH into your Raspberry Pi and navigate to the project directory:

```bash
ssh pi@<raspberry_pi_ip>
cd /home/pi/speakersaver
```
Create and activate a virtual environment, then install dependencies:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Run the setup script:

```bash
python3 setup_env.py
```
#### Step 3: Configure the Service to Run on Startup
##### Step 1: Create a `start_services.sh` script to run your project:
1. Create script file:
```bash
sudo nano ~/start_services.sh
```
2. Add the following script:
```bash
#!/bin/bash

echo "Starting speaker saver service"
sleep 10

echo "Starting virtual environment"
cd /home/plisker/speaker-saver
source venv/bin/activate
echo "Virtual environment is ready"

env > /home/plisker/speaker-saver/script_env.txt

# Run auth and main scripts
python -m src.auth &
AUTH_PID=$!
echo "Auth script started with PID: $AUTH_PID"

python -m src.main &
MAIN_PID=$!
echo "Main script started with PID: $MAIN_PID"

wait $AUTH_PID
wait $MAIN_PID
```

##### Step 2: Create a `systemd` service to start your project automatically on boot:

1. Create a service file:
```bash
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/speaker-saver.service
```
2. Add the following configuration, making sure to change your paths as necessary:
```ini
[Unit]
Description=Speaker Saver Service
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=simple
ExecStart=/home/plisker/start_services.sh
WorkingDirectory=/home/plisker/speaker-saver
StandardOutput=inherit
StandardError=inherit
User=plisker

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```
3. Enable and start the service:
```bash
sudo systemctl enable speaker-saver.service
sudo systemctl start speaker-saver.service
```

## Debugging

If, on the Raspberry Pi, you get an error about the `add_event_handler`, you may need to run this after activating the venv:

```bash
sudo apt remove python3-rpi.gpio
```

## Health Monitoring
SpeakerSaver logs its health status to `health.log` and makes this information available through an HTTP endpoint exposed by the Flask server. You can monitor the systemâ€™s health by visiting the `/health` endpoint provided by the Flask server and a simple log in the `/logs` endpoint.

## Port Forwarding
If you need to access the endpoints on your Raspberry Pi from your local computer, you can set up port forwarding. Add the following configuration to your `~/.ssh/config` file:

```ini
Host raspberrypi
    HostName <raspberrypi-host>
    User <raspberrypi-username>
    LocalForward 8888 127.0.0.1:8888
```

After running `ssh raspberrypi`, you will be able to access the endpoints on your computer by navigating to `http://localhost:8888`. For example, the `/health` endpoing will be [`http://localhost:8888/health`](http://localhost:8888/health).

Please note that the `HostName` may differ depending on your Raspberry Pi's configuration.

## Future Enhancements
PIP Distribution: In the future, the project will be packaged for easy installation via PIP, eliminating the need for manual SCP transfers.
